####1.	Project Description
Objective
The objective of this project was to refactor the existing code to display the current day on the hader. When viewing time blocks, they are color coded to show if they are in the past, present or future. When you click into a time block you can enter a text note for a task that you need to complete for the day, and when the save button is clicked, it saves the tasks in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
